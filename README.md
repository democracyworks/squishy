# squishy

A Clojure library for safely and reliably consuming SQS messages.

## Usage

```clj
(ns demo
  [squishy.core :as sqs])

(defonce consumer-id (atom nil))

(defn process-message [message]
  (println "Processing: " message)
  ;; ... do something fancy
  )

(let [creds {:access-key "AKIA..."
             :access-secret "8jcNZ9mM..."
             :region #aws/region "US_EAST_1"}
      cid (sqs/consume-messages creds
                                "incoming-queue"
                                "failure-queue"
                                process-message)]
  (reset! consumer-id cid))

;; later when you are done:

(sqs/stop-consumer @consumer-id)
```

### Region

You can send several values in for the `:region` component of the credentials.

* "us-east-1": you can send in a string that conforms to the "name" of the region, lowercase with dashes
* "US_EAST_1": you can send in a string that conforms to the string version of the Regions enum, uppercase with underscores
* com.amazonaws.regions.Region: you can send in an actual instance of the Region class

There's a data-reader tag defined as `#aws/region` that can convert a string in either of
the top two formats into a Region class instance as well.

### Shutting down

**IMPORTANT:** Squishy is quite aggressive at recovering from exceptions and
resuming processing of messages. This behavior is necessary to maintain 
long-term reliable connections to SQS.

A side effect of this is that squishy will interpret the exceptions that it 
receives when you stop / undeploy your app as things to recover from. If you
see the "Consuming SQS messages from..." log message after attempting to stop a
squishy app, then you are running into this problem.

As of version 3.0.0, you **MUST** keep the `consumer-id` returned by 
`consume-messages` and call `(squishy.core/stop-consumer consumer-id)` when
you are shutting down / undeploying your app. This will tell squishy to stop
trying to recover that consumer.

### Visibility timeouts

> For some background on visibility timeouts in SQS, we recommend [reading 
Amazon's documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html).

In version 3.0.0, squishy gained the ability to adjust the visibility timeout
of the messages it's processing automatically. The visibility timeout default
is 30 seconds, which means that 30 seconds after a consumer starts processing a
message, SQS will make it available to other consumers if the original consumer
hasn't deleted it. Since this is not usually what you expect or want, squishy 
now informs SQS that it should increase the visibility timeout of individual 
messages when it knows that the provided processing function is still 
processing that message. This means that other consumers won't see the message.

If your SQS queue has a different visibility timeout configured, you can use
the 5-arity version of `consume-messages` to tell squishy when it should raise
the visibility timeout. So, for example, if you have configured your queue with
a 300-second visibility timeout, you should call `consume-messages` like this:

```
(sqs/consume-messages creds
                      "incoming-queue"
                      "failure-queue"
                      {:visibility-timeout 300}
                      process-message)
```

It doesn't hurt to not do this as squishy assumes 30 second visibility timeouts
by default. It would just result in more SQS API calls than are strictly
necessary.

### Very Long Running Jobs

If you sometimes/often have jobs that run over the maximum visibility timeout
for SQS (12 hours), you will get new copies of the message spawning without
bounds every 12 hours until you manually intervene. Since this is undesireable,
there is an option you can provide to `consume-messages` called `:delete-callback`.
When set to true, your processing function will receive two arguments, the
message to process and a callback function to be called when enough information has
been stored to keep track of the job. Calling this function will then delete the
message from SQS and no copies will spawn (presuming you have called this prior
to the 12 hour maximum visibility timeout).

```
(defn my-processor [message delete-callback]
  (record-job message)
  (delete-callback)
  (very-long-job-kickoff message))


(sqs/consume-messages creds q-name f-q-name {:delete-callback true} my-processor)
```
